# Audio Header Parser

This is a C++ implementation of a program to parse the content of .wav file and print the information stored in its header.

.wav files are RIFF files (Resource Interchange File Format) which start out with a header followed by a sequence of data chunks.

For more information about the RIFF file chunks and specifications: [The Canonical WAVE File Format](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/422-winter-2014/projects/WaveFormat/#:~:text=The%20canonical%20WAVE%20format%20starts,the%20chunk%20following%20this%20number.)
